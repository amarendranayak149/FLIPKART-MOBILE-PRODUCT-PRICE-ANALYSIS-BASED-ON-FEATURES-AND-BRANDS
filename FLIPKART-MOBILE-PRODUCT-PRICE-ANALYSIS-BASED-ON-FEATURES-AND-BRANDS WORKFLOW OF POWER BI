- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Used for complex calculations and performance metrics.
- **Excel/CSV Data Processing**: Cleaning and transforming datasets.
- **Mapping Tools**: Integrated visualizations for better insights into brand distribution.

## üìä Data Insights & Key Findings

## ‚öô DAX Formulas Used

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Total Sales Calculation**
```DAX
Total Sales = SUM(SalesData[Sales])
```
Calculates the total number of mobile units sold.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Average Selling Price**
```DAX
Avg Selling Price = AVERAGE(SalesData[Selling Price])
```
Finds the average price across all mobile brands.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Maximum and Minimum Price**
```DAX
Max Price = MAX(SalesData[Selling Price])
Min Price = MIN(SalesData[Selling Price])
```
Determines the highest and lowest prices in the dataset.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Price Segmentation (Budget, Mid-Range, Premium)**
```DAX
Price Category =
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    SalesData[Selling Price] <= 15000, "Budget",
    SalesData[Selling Price] > 15000 && SalesData[Selling Price] <= 30000, "Mid-Range",
    SalesData[Selling Price] > 30000, "Premium"
)
```
Categorizes phones based on their price range.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ 5G vs Non-5G Price Difference**
```DAX
5G Price Difference =
CALCULATE(AVERAGE(SalesData[Selling Price]), SalesData[Is_5G] = TRUE()) -
CALCULATE(AVERAGE(SalesData[Selling Price]), SalesData[Is_5G] = FALSE())
```
Finds the difference in average selling prices between **5G and Non-5G models**.

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Count of Models per Brand**
```DAX
Models Per Brand = COUNT(SalesData[Model Name])
```
Counts the total number of models available per brand.

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Average Rating by Price Category**
```DAX
Avg Rating by Category =
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(SalesData[Customer Rating]),
    ALLEXCEPT(SalesData, SalesData[Price Category])
)
```
Computes the average customer rating for each **price category** (Budget, Mid-Range, Premium).

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Correlation Between Price and Ratings**
```DAX
Correlation_Price_Rating =
CORREL(SalesData[Selling Price], SalesData[Customer Rating])
```
Finds the statistical correlation between **price and customer ratings**.
